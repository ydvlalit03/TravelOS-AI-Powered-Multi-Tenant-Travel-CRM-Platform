"""Async database engine, session, and tenant Row-Level Security helpers.

Multi-tenancy is enforced at two layers:
  1. Application: every tenant-scoped query carries ``tenant_id``.
  2. Database: Postgres RLS policies filter rows by the ``app.current_tenant``
     GUC, set per request. The app connects as a NON-superuser role
     (``travelos_app``) so RLS is actually enforced (superusers bypass it).

Routes must NOT call ``session.commit()`` themselves — ``get_db`` wraps each
request in a single transaction and commits on success / rolls back on error.
This also makes ``SET LOCAL`` of the tenant GUC scoped to the request.
